# Fast-2d-Lighting-Engine
This is a modification of the lighting engine described by Mike Dailly on a yoyogames techblog. It uses a single static model for each light and modifies its vertexes on a shader instead of pushing a new primitive each time, giving a massive speed bost. I think it is faster than anyother on the yoyogames store.

There are two executables included on zip files, one using the original mike's method and other using the described modification. Check out both for comparision.
