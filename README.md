# Fast-2d-Lighting-Engine
This is a modification of the lighting engine described by MikeDailly on a yoyogames techblog. It uses a single static model for each light and modifies its vertexes on a shader instead of pushing a new primitive each time, giving a massive speed bost. I think it is faster than anyother on the yoyogames store.
